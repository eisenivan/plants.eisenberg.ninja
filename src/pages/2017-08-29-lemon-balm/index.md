The lemon balm against our back fence has a story behind it. Our next door neighbors to the West confided in me that the lemon balm was planted on purpose at one point. They were hoping to have it on hand for the occasional cup of tea. It has since run wild. I don't personally know much about lemon balm, but here is what I do know.

* It spreads like wild fire
* It is relatively easy to pull out by the roots
* It does, in-fact, smell like lemons

Against my better judgement my plan is to move a few plants worth to a hanging basket, hopefully containing the monster, while still having it available for the occasional cup of tea (or cocktail). I have had trouble growing anything in those hanging baskets, and hope that the heartyness and moxy of the lemon balm will put an end to my struggles. I will continue ripping it out by the roots whenever I see it in the wild (my yard).
