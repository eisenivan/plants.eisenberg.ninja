Looks like a clover, but with perfect heart shaped leaves. We have this growing as a weed all over the neighborhood. Finally a neighbor told me it was edible. It has a nice, sour flavor that goes very nicely in assorted salads. You can eat the entire plant, stems and all. I have also heard it called "lemon clover"

When I took my picture the sorrel's little yellow flowers had already died off, you can still *kind of* see them in the picture. They have long seed pods, but really the most identifiable thing about the wood sorrel is the perfect heart shaped leaves, and sour flavor.
