![Ivan and Emilia](./ivan-and-emilia.jpg)

I grew up in the country. I didn't always appreciate it, or take advantage of it, or even like it, but I did. I have since moved to Milwaukee, and every day that goes by I notice more and more how different it is. I like living in the city, but reflecting back on my childhood I understand now how great the country can be for a young kid.

I have very recently had my first child, a little girl named Emilia. She seems destined to grow up in the city. As parenthood rapidly approached I began to grow a little anxious. I realized that I had a growing desire to teach her about the natural world that I experienced when I was younger. Unfortunately, I don't really know that much about it myself.

Then I had an idea, we could learn together. A few weeks before her birth I decided that we would start with plants. I've always been envious of my friends that can take a walk and identify all the plants and trees. I decided to start small. Let's get a handle of all the plants we can find in the yard.

Since we purchased our first home I've become something of a casual bad gardener. We have three raised beds (that we inherited with the house) and I've done my best to plant and harvest them. I actually quite like it. Those plants will be easy (I hope). We also have a good deal of landscaping along the front of our house and in a few back yard beds. Then, of course, their are the unwanted yard guests: *the weeds.*

I'll wrap this post up with my goal. I'm hoping that by documenting what I learn on this blog I will be able to remember more, and be able to reference the blog to refresh my own memory. I'm also hoping it might be fun to revisit this blog when Emilia is older. And if I can somehow get someone else interested in nature, or help anyone identify a plant, or anything even remotely close to that idea I suppose we can count that as a win as well.

Hopefully this goes well, but I suppose only time will tell.
