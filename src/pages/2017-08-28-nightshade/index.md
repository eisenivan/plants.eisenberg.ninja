![Nightshade in Milwaukee, Wisconsin](./nightshade.jpg)

We have nightshade. We seem to get 4 or 5 plants a season and I do my best to pull it out by the roots as soon as I notice it. This year with the baby distraction I let a few go a bit too long. It's very easy to identify once it starts getting it's berries.

I'm going to do my best to get some photos next year as it starts growing. With the baby starting to crawl around, and our furry faithful companion with her curious ways this is one I'd like to not having in the yard.
